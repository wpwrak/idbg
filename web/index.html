<H1>The Internal Debug Board</H1>

<I><B>Disclaimer:</B> This is something I did in my spare time. My "daytime"
work for Openmoko is not related to this project except that it provides
me with old and defective prototypes and spare parts to use for my experiments,
and of course with plenty of opportunities to tinker with Neo internals.</I>

<H2>Design</H2>

The Internal Debug Board (IDBG) is designed to provide the following
features:
<UL>
  <LI> Connects directly to <B>USB</B> (Micro-USB, for space reasons)
  <LI> IDBG firmware can be updated with <B>DFU</B>
    <!-- independent of state of Neo -->
  <LI> IDBG gives access to the Neo <B>serial console</B>
    <!-- , with the host using the Linux "generic USB serial" driver -->
  <LI> IDBG gives access to <B>JTAG</B>
    <!-- , with the host using a IDBG-specific driver for OpenOCD -->
  <LI> IDBG can act as a master on the <B>I2C</B> bus
    <!-- , allowing I2C devices to be accessed using IDBG-specific tools -->
  <LI> IDBG handles the model-specific signals
    nGSM_EN (GTA01) and nNOR_WP (GTA02)
  <LI> If it is not used, the IDBG is transparent to the rest of the system
</UL>
Note that not all of this has been implemented and tested so far.
<P>


<H2>Illustrated build process</H2>

The board consists of a

<A href="https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/usb/Pages/C8051F3267.aspx">C8051F326</A>
microcontroller (QFN-28, 0.5mm pitch), the micro-USB B connector, and a few
discrete components (mainly 0402). The PCB itself is single-sided with 8mil
traces and 5mil clearance between traces. The circuit is designed for DIY
PCB production using the
<A href="http://www.fullnet.com/~tomg/gooteepc.htm">toner transfer</A>
method and manual soldering.

IDBG comes with a sub-board that gives access
to the signals needed for programming the internal Flash of the
microcontroller. This sub-board is called the "IPL" board, for
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load">Initial
Program Load</A>.

<P>
On the left picture we see the IDBG board alone, on the right picture
it is mounted on a Debug Board v3 (v1 and v2 are not suitable but the
board could also be wired directly to the Neo).
In this configuration, power can be supplied
through a GPIO pin and basic communication with the microcontroller
is possible, e.g., to perform a boundary scan.
<P>
<!--
If attached to a Debug Board v3 as shown above, EINT3 (GPF3) connects
through a 100&Omega; resistor to the VSYS pad of the Internal Debug Board.
Thus, power can be enabled with
<BR><PRE>neo# gpio f3=1</PRE><BR>
Note that the resistor may prevent some mishap if there is an overcurrent
situation, but it is not designed to prevent damage in case of a
short-circuit.
<P>
-->
For Flash programming, USB must be connected to provide additional power.
A simple Flash programmer
called <B>f326</B> that runs on the Neo is included in the git repository.
Please consult the README for further details.
<P>
After the initial programming, the IPL sub-board is cut off and the IDBG
board is glued on top of the GPS shield.

<P>
Next, we make a hole for the USB receptacle in the Neo's case. The
picture on the left shows the general lay of the land. Cutting the hole
is a process of trial and error and requires some patience.
It helps to remove only about a millimeter of material at a time and then
to check the position of the connector, as shown in
the middle. On the right, we see the final hole from the inside.
<P>

<A href="hole-inside.jpg"><IMG src="hole-inside.jpg" width=284 height=213></A>
<P>
The result should look like my clumsy attempt on the left, but hopefully a bit
more precise and with fewer scratches. The IDBG's PCB may shine through if
the hole is too high. This can be hidden by painting the edge black with a
permanent marker. On the right, we see what the Neo now looks like. It is
important that the entire case closes properly.

With the mechanics sorted out, we now return to the electronics.
A ground connection is added (this is the wire sticking out on the left
in the middle image below&nbsp;&emdash;&nbsp;<A href="ww-gnd.jpg">here</A>
is a better view of the ground connection) and thin wires are soldered
to all the pads used in this configuration. Marking both ends of each
wire with a "Morse code" as shown in the wiring diagram makes it easier
to make the right connections.

<P>
The wires are then bundled with heat-shrink tubing and brought across
the board edge to the top. (These pictures are from an earlier prototype,
hence the different color of the PCB and the much larger side hole, which
was made for Mini USB.)
<P>
What follows is one of the highlight of the entire
operation, soldering the wires coming from IDBG to the test points on the
main PCB.

<P>
If we keep the path to the FPC connector clear, it's even
possible to have the internal debug board coexist with an external
one.
<P>
The wires shown above are stranded 30 AWG wires with an outer diameter
of 32mil or 0.8mm. This is about the thickest type of wire that can be
used&nbsp;&emdash;&nbsp;anything thicker would overflow the free space
under and around the board, and also the contacts on IDBG would be spaced
too closely. The images below show an alternative solution: wire-wrap
wires with a solid core that have an outer diameter of only about 20mil
or 0.5mm.
<P>

<P>
The main disadvantage of wire-wrap wires is their rigidity and thus a
higher risk of mechanical failure. The image in the middle also highlights
another problem: the isolation becomes very soft and vulnerable when heated.
If the wire is held down with a fingernail during soldering, the fingernail
may penetrate and damage the isolation. It's better to hold the wire with
something softer, e.g., the fingertip.
<P>
The last step is to close the case. There are some structures inside
the top cover that conflict with the new cables and must therefore
be removed. Their remnants have been marked with a yellow sheen in
the picture below:

<P>
The right-hand side contains almost exactly the same structures,
which are left untouched. Note that it is not necessary to trim the
plastic wall next to the LCM if the wires are thin enough.
<P>
Gee, it still runs !

  <LI> DFU upload causes stray stalls if sending EP0-sized packets
  <LI> f326 sometimes locks up
  <LI> Organization of code and repository isn't nice
  <LI> Need more fine-grained licensing, e.g., CC for schematics,
    LGPL for libraries
  <LI> Flow control of serial console is broken in the host to target direction
</UL>
For further study:
<UL>
  <LI> IDBG should be able to command the PMU during power-up,
    e.g., allowing it to limit inrush current and to override PMU
    settings
  <LI> Could we merge USB power from IDBG into VBUS ?
  <LI> Could IDBG snoop the I2C bus and report transactions ?
  <LI> Consider adding special serial console functions. Some ideas:
    ~r to reset (GPIO), ~p to power down (PMU),
    ~d to dump the log buffer from a crashed kernel (JTAG), ...
